    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>My name is Brendan O'Connor. I am in the CS + Music Program which is computer science and music related classes for a major in music and a bachelors degree in computer science. 
    I am looking to continue my education in computer science after four years at Lewis to help create a good resume for jobs in the field of computer science. Music is a very big interest
    of mine. I have been playing guitar since I was four years old and now I am almost always working on producing music. My genres include rock, metal, jazz, classical, r&b, fusion, and trap. 
    I listen to a lot of different kinds of music, but the guitar, different rhythms, and sounds in them is what sparks my interest in for me. I also really enjoy sub bass/ 808's in music. 
    In terms of my family I have an older brother and parents. I also have a pet tortoise which I count as family.

<h2>What I Hope To Learn In This Course</h2>
<p> &#9632; I hope to become fluent in Python so I can code just from the ideas that come to me with no latency of researching objects,etc<br>
    
      
    <br>
</p>
<p> &#9632; I want to be able to make websites easily using this same method of HTML and CSS.<br>
    
      
    <br>
</p>
<p> &#9632; I want to learn more about computer hardware and the circuit processes of the computer while it is in use.<br>
    
      
    <br>
</p>
<p> &#9632; I want to prepare myself for the next courses in computer science by putting in a lot of effort and practicing regularly.<br>

<h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
<p> My favorite hobby would still have to be music like I said before. I enjoy to do some other things like working out and doing stuff with friends, but I feel my main interest in music.   I play guitar like I said before but I also play the electric bass, stand-up bass, and piano. These are all things I enjoy playing, but I like guitar the most out of them. I feel that
coding will definitely become a hobby of mine not just to do coursework, but to make projects of my own. I have ideas for plugins that I could make for digital audio workstation's recording software
that I know can be innovative. It is just a matter of putting in the work to learn how to do it professionally.<br>

<h2>Greatest Innovation</h2>
<p> &#9632; THE INTERNET: The concept of the internet existed long before it was possible to exist. Many other inventors can be creditted to the creation of it, but not specifically its invention. 
    Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn are known to be the inventors of the internet. 1969 was the first year that a computer network was created. A link for the information I found on this is right <a href="https://www.britannica.com/story/who-invented-the-internet">here.</a>


</p>
<p>&#9632; PC's and LAPTOPS: The creation of personal computers most commonly credited to Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. There are many other people involved, but those are people I think of the most.
  The internet couldnt exist and wouldn't be what it is without computers that the average person can own or have acsess to. This is by far the most important innovation in terms of making computers mainstream. Computer making is such a world changing thing and the more advancements that are made will only increase our capabilties.
  This is an very informative link on the timeline of the creation of computers. It can be found <a href="https://www.livescience.com/20718-computer-history.html">here.</a>

   
<p> &#9632; EMAIL: It is very hard to choose three out of the many innovations made in computing history, but I think that email deserves a place on this list, because it is one of the first and most widely used methods of communication of computers. The credit to this one goes to Ray Tomlinson. The first non networked version of email began as a program called "Mailbox" in 1965 at MIT on a single computer. Users of the computer could login to their account and see what mail was receieved on the same computer. The first inter computer mail exchange took place in 1969 by the United States Department of Defense program called              
"ARPANET" or Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. Only a few years later the process was becoming much more efficient and emails were being sent constantly. It is important to note that this still took place on an internal network. In the 1980's notably starting in 1981 some internet service providers went public and they allowed
for emails to be sent throughout a web of networks (no pun intended). In the 1990s email had become very mainstream and its applications were everywhere. Services like AOL, Echomail, Hotmail, and many others existed allowing for 400 million users by 1997.
